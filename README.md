# **Bioinformatics-data-skills-final-exam**

## **The purpose**

This repo was created to explain the final exam goals and how they were achieved step by step. 

## **The goals of the final exam**

- Creating a 100x100 numpy array (100x100 matrix)
- Making a heatmap of 100x100 array
- Filtering out the odd numbers
- Converting True/False statements into [0,1] values
- Making a heatmap of new 100x100 array

## **The road map**

In order to achieve these goals, first of all, jupyter lab or jupyter notebook must be downloaded from anaconda navigator and opened with terminal. Jupyter notebook runs pyton compatible and all programs defined in pyton can be run in jupyter notebook. Using jupyter notebook and necessary pyton programs, all commands to achieve the above goals were executed and outputs were obtained. You can reach the explaination my code, the usage of my code and its outputs, step by step with the ***Final_Gunes.ipynb*** text, which is a jupyter notebook printout in this repo.
